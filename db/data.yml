    - The Wind is Taken into Consideration
    - |-
      The sun is bright outside my office window,
      reflecting off of the snow huddled around the
      outside edges of the sparsely populated
      parking lot between my office and the
      off-white house-ocean with yards barely
      wide enough to fit a mower between the
      fence and the porch.
      
      If Hindu scholars hadn't pioneered the use
      of the number 0, would it be 1 degree
      Fahrenheit outside, making all the difference
      between being something and being nothing
      and even being less than nothing when the
      wind is taken into consideration.
      
      Japanese girls are asleep right now, resting
      their bloody thumbs from furiously drafting
      cell phone novels about angst, passion, clothes
      and infectious disease on the long ride from
      somewhere to elsewhere on another train in
      a long line of trains into tunnels in the dark.
      
      There are far too many love/sex songs about
      bedrooms and far too few about the woods and
      the pool at the bottom of the waterfall where
      you might interrupt a monk with his beads,
      working them through his hands as the falling
      water pushes down on his shoulders leaving
      thumb prints, without blood and cool but
      not as cold as the window pane and the
      plastic hanging blinds next to my desk.

    - The Wedding Photo
    - "Morgantown went uphill and downhill.\r\n\
      It never went across level,\r\n\
      even ground.\r\n\
      I could jump from my back yard \r\n\
      and land\r\n\
      on the neighbor\xE2\x80\x99s roof.  \r\n\
      Some mornings\r\n\
      the fog could almost be held.\r\n\
      Three years passed between the first and\r\n\
      \r\n\
      second time we slept together.\r\n\
      Two students from Pitt drowned\r\n\
      in the river a year apart.\r\n\
      Days later they always\r\n\
      floated up downstream\xE2\x80\x94\r\n\
      identifiable only\r\n\
      by their teeth.\r\n\
      I remember every semester as overcast and\r\n\
      rainy, like walking across loose bricks;\r\n\
      dirty water squishing from the gaps,\r\n\
      leaving grey stains on my\r\n\
      jeans and socks.\r\n\
      I study my reflection in the wedding photo\xE2\x80\x94\r\n\
      in you dancing around with\r\n\
      a white smile\r\n\
      and a bridesmaid\xE2\x80\x99s dress\r\n\
      and all I can picture\r\n\
      of my former room is a\r\n\
      bent clothes hangar \r\n\
      nailed to the wall."

    - Lost Dog
    - |-
      I wander into the Lost Dog and smell the blend
      of dry coffee and dry tea gently diffused through
      the years from portioned bags lining the brick walls
      on dull green, dented tin shelves.
      
      Somewhere along the way, the days grew shorter
      and my sentences grew longer and my friends
      moved closer or farther away as the whine of the
      espresso machine puts me back in the room.
      
      All the while I have been sipping my chai, turning
      pages, throwing glances sideways as people walk
      by and I reach the bottom of my cup where all
      the honey has settled to bitterly coat my tongue.
      
      Looking around the tables, couches and chairs I
      see young kids acting like mature adults
      and mature adults acting like young kids and
      me, reading my book, somewhere in between.

    - In Loving Memory of Betty Duewel
    - |-
      I helped carry my grandmother's casket
      to the burial plot on a windy day so windy
      that memorial flowers careened across the
      graveyard like tumbleweed.  So windy that
      mourner's suits caught the wind, billowed
      out and pushed them closer to the opening
      in the ground.
      
      I was not prepared for how heavy the
      casket would be, holding my thin grandmother
      who had been ravaged by dysentery in
      her early years trying to take polytheism
      from the Hindus.  Perhaps our spirits make our
      bodies lighter until they leave, but then
      I'm just in the kind of mood that takes
      you sometimes after your distant relative
      tries to raise your grandma from the dead.
      
      I thought about this for a while.  One
      of the men lowering the casket dropped
      his notebook and pen and had to climb
      in to retrieve them.  If she woke and
      sat up, then the service would have been
      over before it started, the embalming
      would have been a bad idea in retrospect
      and I would have had to start loving others
      out of fear instead of loving others for the
      way it makes me feel the world is right.
      
      After I got home, I climbed on to the
      roof of my house and let the sun set
      behind me while I sat on the shingles and
      faced the East, following the line
      described by an angel with a trumpet
      on the Freemason's meeting house
      three blocks down the street.  I thought
      about how relieved I was that I didn't
      drop the casket and about the nice things
      people said about my grandmother that
      I never knew before.

    - The Wind is Taken into Consideration
    - |-
      The sun is bright outside my office window,
      reflecting off of the snow huddled around the
      outside edges of the sparsely populated
      parking lot between my office and the
      off-white house-ocean with yards barely
      wide enough to fit a mower between the
      fence and the porch.
      
      If Indian scholars hadn't pioneered the use
      of the number 0, would it be 1 degree
      Fahrenheit outside, making all the difference
      between being something and being nothing
      and even being less than nothing when the
      wind is taken into consideration.
      
      Japanese girls are asleep right now, resting
      their bloody thumbs from furiously drafting
      cell phone novels about angst, passion, clothes
      and infectious disease on the long ride from
      somewhere to elsewhere on another train in
      a long line of trains into tunnels in the dark.
      
      There are far too many love/sex songs about
      bedrooms and far too few about the woods and
      the pool at the bottom of the waterfall where
      you might interrupt a monk with his beads,
      working them through his hands as the falling
      water pushes down on his shoulders leaving
      thumb prints, without blood and cool but
      not as cold as the window pane and the
      plastic hanging blinds next to my desk.
